# Credit Scoring Model

## Description
The Credit Scoring Model repository aims to build a predictive model for a bank, enabling data-driven lending decisions. This model utilizes the Logistic Regression classifier and decile methodology to formulate an effective lending strategy.

## Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Logistic Regression
- Decile Methodology

## Installation Instructions
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Scoring-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Credit-Scoring-Model
    ```

3. Open the project in Google Colab or any Python environment with the required dependencies installed.

## Usage
Users can interact with the Credit Scoring Model as follows:
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data if necessary.
2. Train the Logistic Regression classifier using the provided dataset.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.
4. Utilize the decile methodology to formulate a lending strategy based on the model predictions.

## Data Sources
The datasets used for training the Logistic Regression classifier are sourced from [mention data sources here, e.g., Kaggle dataset 'Banking_Credit_Scoring'].

## Methodology
The decile methodology employed in formulating the lending strategy involves segmenting the customer base into ten equal groups based on their credit scores. This approach allows the bank to prioritize lending decisions and allocate resources effectively.
